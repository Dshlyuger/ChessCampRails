Cucumeber tests fail because of random geocoding errors when run as a bundle sometimes but indivudally it passes, talked to professor heimann on  May 6th 11th about this.
Please check it individually if this issue arises from these or other cucumber tests(weird geocoding errors when  running as a bundle sometimes).

Unit tests also act strangeley sometimes, they are inconcsisent, returning the right test coverage (in the 97-98 percent area) and sometimes claiming to be 97 % covered but in the output showing 81 percent and a lot of code that is from the previous phase as not covered(Despite all the tests supposedley passing). Please try it a few times if this happens because it really does seem random and gives very different results.
